### Hi there 👋

#### About Me
Hello! I'm a data professional with three years of experience in Machine Learning. I find the world of data science incredibly fascinating. Currently, I'm working as a Senior Product Manager at ICICI Lombard GIC.
While I enjoy my current role, I'm actively looking for opportunities in the field of data science. My skill set includes Python, SQL, Power BI, Machine Learning, and statistics.
If you're on the lookout for a data-passionate, slightly witty (okay, maybe more than slightly) professional who can turn data into gold while sharing a good laugh, let's connect! 🤝 Your data challenges are my adventure quests, and I'm the missing piece to your data puzzle. 🔍🧩
